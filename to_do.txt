-> try on a non-multiband test directory (maybe also from consult)
-> investigate - any possible other header fields to use?
-> direct plot of each set of timestamps 
    --> compared to expected linear rise?
    --> maybe _subtracting_ expected linear rise?
-> since timestamps appear very different, and since PMU was started and
    stopped a pretty short time before/after the run, this may be a good
    opportunity to vet accuracy.

It's very odd that the "CT minus AT" plot is steadily increasing. In earlier 
tests it started out off by a little but the difference gradually decreased.
